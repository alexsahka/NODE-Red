<h1>Sample</h1>
The sample directory contains a Web browser client using the Telenor SMS nodes.
The sample Web page can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://noderedjo2.mybluemix.net/telenorsms/">here</a>

<p>
<strong>settings.js</strong> contains Node-RED settings, also also settings for 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptico">Cryptico</a>
private and public key, which is used by Node-RED flows to decrypt user input from the client (which encrypts the data with the public key).
</p>

<p>
<strong>generatekeys.js</strong> is an example of using the Cryptico library to generate public and private keys.
</p>

<h1>Node-RED flows</h1>
